        <p class="verse-label">Verse 1</p>
        <pre>
            I once had a life, or rather, life had me
            I was one among many or at least I seemed to be
            Well, I read an old quotation in a book just yesterday
            Said "Gonna reap just what you sow
            The debts you make you have to pay."
            Can you get to that?
        </pre>

        <p class="verse-label hook-label">Hook</p>
        <pre class="hook">
            Can you get (I wanna know)
            I want to know if you can get to that (hey! get to that!)
            Can you get (can you get to that? I wanna know)
            I want to know if you can get to that
        </pre>

        <pre>
            I recollect with a-mixed emotions
            All the good times we used to have
            But you were making preparations
            For the coming separation
            And you blew everything we had
            When you base your love on credit
            And your loving days are done
            Checks you signed with a-love and kisses
            Later come back signed "insufficient funds"
            Yeah, get to that
        </pre>

            Can you get (can you get to that? I wanna know)
            I want to know if you can get to that
            Can you get (I wanna know)
            I want to know if you can get to that (hey! get to that!)
            Can you get (can you get to that? I wanna know)
            I want to know if you can get to that
            Can you get
