            If you want me to stay
            I'll be around today
            To be available for you to see

            But I am about to go
            And then you'll know
            For me to stay here I got to be me

            You'll never be in doubt
            That's what it's all about
            You can't take me for granted and smile

            Count the days I'm gone
            Forget reachin' me by phone
            Because I promise I'll be gone for a while

            And when you see me again
            I hope that you have been
            The kind of person....that you really are now

            Got to get in straight
            How could I ever be late
            When you're my woman taking up my time

            Whoa, oh how could I ever allow
            I guess I wonder how
            I could get out a pocket for fun (HOW HOW)

            When you know that you're never number two
            Number one's gonna be number one
            Ohh oww oohh

            I'll be good
            I wish I could
            I get this message over to you now

            [Outro]
            And when you see me again
            I hope that you have been
            The kind of person....that you really are now

            I'll be so good
            I wish I could
            I get this message over to you now
